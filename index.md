## Maitreya Suin
I am a PhD student at <a href="http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/ipcvlab/">Image Processing and Computer Vision Lab</a>, IIT Madras. I received my Bachelors Degree in Electrical Engineering from . <a href="http://iem.edu.in/">Institute of Engineering and Management, Kolkata</a> My research lies at the intersection of Image Processing/Computer Vision and Deep Learning. My recent works have focused on efficient dense video captioning with the help of reinforcement learning, restoration of images suffering from blur, low-resolution, and haze.
