I am a final-year PhD scholar at **[Image Processing and Computer Vision Lab, IIT Madras](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/ipcvlab/)**. I received my Bachelor's Degree in Electronics and Communications Engineering from **[Institute of Engineering and Management, Kolkata](http://iem.edu.in/)**. My research lies at the intersection of Computer Vision, Deep Learning, and Deep Reinforcement Learning. I have worked toward building adaptive neural networks for handling spatially and temporally varying tasks. My recent works have focused on image and video enhancement using efficient non-local attention modules, image inpainting, and spatially-varying restoration of images suffering from blur, low-resolution, rain, haze, etc. I have also worked on a few vision-and-language problems, such as dense video captioning from a long video with multiple temporal events.
